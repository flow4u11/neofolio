# MY PORTFOLIO

I have created my portfolio based on the provided design.

## How to View

### Option 1: Quick View (Recommended if you cannot run npm)
Open the file **`index.html`** in your browser.
This version uses the Tailwind CSS CDN and works instantly without any installation.

### Option 2: Production Build (Vite)
This project is set up as a standard **Vite + Tailwind** application for better performance and future development.

If you have Node.js installed and can run scripts:
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run `npm install` (to install dependencies).
3. Run `npm run dev` (to start the development server).
4. Open the localhost link provided.

**Note:** If you see "running scripts is disabled on this system" errors in PowerShell, use `cmd` or bypass the policy, or stick to Option 1.

## Design Features
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on mobile and desktop.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for all styling.
- **Poppins Font**: Integrated from Google Fonts.
- **Section Structure**: Hero, About (Bento Grid), Showcase, Contact.
